The main goal of this exciting game is to give users a chance to have fun while improving their English vocabulary. Through the task of guessing hidden phrases made up of a mixture of letters, players will be able to test their language skills and expand their knowledge of the English language.

Before diving into the action of the game, users will need to complete a simple registration process
in our database. This registration will allow them to access a world of challenges and learning.
Once users have logged into the system, they will be greeted by an attractive and personalized menu
that will provide them with options to explore their game statistics, as well as the chance to
participate in exciting matches.
Within the game itself, players will be able to test their ability to decipher the hidden phrases. They
will have the option of entering a letter each turn or, if they feel confident enough, they can take a
chance and guess the entire phrase. However, it must be taken into account that if after 20 turns the
phrase has not yet been discovered, the game will be considered lost and points will be deducted
from the player.

The scoring system is designed to motivate players to keep going and improve themselves. Each
discovered letter will award 10 points, which will serve as an immediate reward for each small
achievement. On the other hand, if a player is able to guess the entire sentence, they will be
rewarded with 100 points, which will be a huge increase in their overall score.
To ensure that the user experience is maintained and your progress is preserved, both player profiles
and statistics will be stored securely in our database.

The implementation of this exciting project will be done using the Java programming language, in
conjunction with the powerful IntelliJ integrated development environment. Various carefully
designed classes and methods will be used to achieve smooth functionality and an immersive
gameplay experience.

In short, this English Phrase Guessing Game presents itself as an engaging and educational
proposition, giving players the chance to enjoy rewarding entertainment while expanding their
English language vocabulary. With a friendly user interface and a motivating scoring system, this
app becomes the perfect choice for those looking to have fun and learn at the same time.
